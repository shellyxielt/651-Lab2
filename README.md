# Project 2

ENGO 551

The project mainly focuses on designing a geoweb application for City of Calgary. After running application.py, you can get a link "http://127.0.0.1:5000/". After pasting the link to your browser, you can get to a page where you can see a map of Calgary, you can either zoom in or zoom out to get a better view of the map.

In the webpage, you can also enter a date range through the date range picker. After clicking the search button, you will get to a page where you can see several markers. After clicking the markers, you can see the detailed information of the spot. When you zoom out the page to a certain extent, some of the markers will be very close to each other. They will gather together to be a number. After clicking the number, you can get the markers again.
